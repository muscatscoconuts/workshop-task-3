new open image function preload

resize image using img.resize

centre image using imageMode (CENTER)

can add in built in filters

array can store multiple values - use square brackets, order of items is important

can put text in arrays

manipulating pixels

pixels x 4 to find all pixels on the pixel array

complex math â€¦ (x + y x width) x 4      bedmas TT
rgba

different displays have different pixel density - pixelDensity () will make it the same on all screens

nested loop is loop within a loop order goes outer inner outer for the loop

img.updatePixels changes pixels in loaded image

**workshop task notes**

I wanted to use a bunch of different tints and filters, so i tinted the images (just random stuff saved to my computer) at the pixel level, and then applied a blur filter over some of them.
i also played with the transparency of the images so that the different coloured images would overlap and create a new colour where they were overlapping
the loop of images just randomly positions them around the canvas to make something that looks new everytime via layering. - i abasically randomised the values of everything..... 
i like the different colours and shades it generated.
